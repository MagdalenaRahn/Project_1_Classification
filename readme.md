This readme.md contains information on Codeup Data Science, Noether cohort, Project 1 : Classification (January 2023).


_Project Goals :
1. To examine the Telco Churn database and, using visualisations in Tableau and statistical tests in the Python programming language.

2. To determine which factor or factors lead to customer churn.


_Initial Hypotheses : 
1. Customer age (Senior Citizens vs non-Senior Citizens) has an influence in churn rate.

2. Customer purchase of tech_support has an influence in churn rate.

3. The internet_service_type (ie, DSL, Fiber optic, no internet service) has an influence in churn rate.

4. Having phone_service in addition to internet service has an influence in churn rate.


_Data Dictionary :
1. Tenure : Customer time with Telco company in months.

2. DF : Dataframe, here referring to the Telco dataset.

3. 


_The Process :
1. Obtain and explore initial, tidied Telco data to examine numbers in the four hypotheses categories. Do this using simple Python coding.

2. Analyse the tidied data based on customer age, customer purchase of security add-ons, customer choice of internet service type, and customer purchase of phone service compared with and to customer purchase of internet service. (These are, also, the four hypotheses to be examined in essaying to determine customer churn rates.)

3. Model the data using comparative visualisations in Tableau.

4. Apply statistical modelling in Python to select data to determine mathematical probability as compared with visual indications.



compared with = similarities and differences
compared to = likening to

For further exploration : If customer purchase of all security add-ons (online_security, online_backup, device_protection, tech_support) has an influence in churn rate.
